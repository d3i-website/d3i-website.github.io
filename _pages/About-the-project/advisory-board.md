## The D3I Project

D3I is a project funded by PDI-SSH. PDI-SSH is responsible for allocating resources to digital infrastructure facilities within the SSH domain, for coordinating digital infrastructures in the SSH domain and for strategy within that domain. For more information, see [their website](https://pdi-ssh.nl/en/). The D3I project runs from March 2022 to February 2025 and primarily aims to make data donation available to all social science and humanities researchers in the Netherlands.
