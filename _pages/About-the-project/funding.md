## Funding

The development of this Data Donation Research Infrastructure has been financed by multiple grants: 

### SSHOC-NL 2024 - 2028

Social Science and Humanities Open Cloud for the Netherlands (SSHOC-NL) is a collaborative effort between ODISSEI (Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations) and CLARIAH (Common Lab Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) to develop cutting-edge infrastructure for social science and humanities research. This initiative aims to open new research avenues of societal importance within these diverse fields. Task 1.2 “Secure Distributed Processing” focuses on integrating the data donation software "Port" in the wider Dutch research infrastructure landscape. Read https://sshoc.nl/ for more information. 

### TDCC "RIGHTS": 2025 - 2027

The goal of this project is to establish cross-institutional standards for the secure and ethical collection, processing, documentation, reuse, and archiving of individual-level digital trace data.

### PDI-SSH "D3I": 2022 - 2025

D3I is a project funded by PDI-SSH. PDI-SSH is responsible for allocating resources to digital infrastructure facilities within the SSH domain, for coordinating digital infrastructures in the SSH domain and for strategy within that domain. The D3I project runs from March 2022 to February 2025 and primarily aims to make data donation available to all social science and humanities researchers in the Netherlands. Under D3I, the software "Port" has been developed to an open source tool that can by used by any researcher. 

### NWO VIDI "Valid measures derived from incidental data:" 2020 - 2024

Under the NWO VIDI project "Valid measures derived from incidental data" awarded to Prof. Dr. D.L. Oberski, the first [proof-of-concept version](https://www.aup-online.com/content/journals/10.5117/CCR2022.2.001.ARAU) of the software "Port" was developed. 

### Research Priority Area Communication & Digital Communication Methods Lab

This research priority area from the University of Amsterdam provided funding to develop the Open-Source Data Donation Framework ([OSD2F](https://www.aup-online.com/content/journals/10.5117/CCR2022.2.001.ARAU)). Important features of OSD2F were later integrated into the software "Port".
