  <h2 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">⚠️ Urgent: Data Donation Research Under Threat</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0;">A proposed EU GDPR amendment could make data donation research impossible. The letter will be sent to the European Commission on <strong>December 15, 2025</strong>.</p>
</div>

## The Issue

The proposed GDPR Omnibus amendment to Article 12(5) would allow data controllers to refuse access requests if deemed for "purposes other than data protection." This seemingly technical change would effectively end data donation research—one of the few independent methods for studying digital platforms in Europe.

### Why This Matters

Data donation research enables critically important studies on topics such as:
- Digital well-being of minors
- Unhealthy or addictive behavior on platforms
- Content exposure and user behavior on social networks
- Political polarization
- Algorithmic systems in gig work platforms


By requiring individuals to exercise their Article 15 GDPR rights to access and voluntarily donate their data, data donation research empowers citizens through participatory knowledge generation. The proposed amendment would give platforms veto power over this independent research.

## Why Data Donation Research Matters

Data donation research:
- ✅ Puts power in the hands of citizens
- ✅ Enables independent scrutiny of powerful platforms
- ✅ Supports evidence-based policymaking
- ✅ Empowers citizen science initiatives
- ✅ Provides an alternative to platform-controlled data access

The GDPR Omnibus, as drafted, would transfer that power back to platforms, giving them legal grounds to refuse requests from citizens engaging in participatory research.
