At Data Donation Symposium 2024 we bring together applied researchers, methodologists, legal and ethical experts, research engineers and software developers with an interest in using digital trace data for scientific research purposes.

#### Keynote

We are happy to announce Melinda Mills as the keynote speaker for the symposium, where she will talk about Data4Science, a platform for individuals to take control of their own data, donate, understand it, shape their own behaviour and share it for broader health and behavioural research. 

Mills is Professor of Demography and Population Health and Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford. She also holds a part-time position as Professor of Data Science and Public Health Policy at the University of Groningen. Data4Science emerged out of her ERC Consolidator Grant SOCIOGENOME, ERC Advanced Grant (CHRONO) and ERC Proof of Concept Grant DNA4Science. She has written 7 books and over 150 articles, including two applied statistics books, in the areas of demography, genetics, inequality, sociology, statistics, health and policy.
