## Behind the screens: Exploring Netflix via Data Donations

- **Summary:** Netflix is often hailed as a disruptor of the traditional media industry, primarily due to its extensive data collection and analysis capabilities, as well as the effectiveness of its recommendation system. As a subscription-based service, Netflix has historically been reticent to share viewing data with external parties. However, under increasing public pressure and with the introduction of an ad-supported tier, Netflix has begun to show greater transparency. Nonetheless, as Lotz (2023) observes, “Netflix is only sharing information it wants to share.” This selective data sharing results in a reliance on Netflix's own narratives about aspects like binge-watching, content popularity and diversity, and the intricacies of their recommendation algorithms. Such narratives contribute to perpetuating myths, limiting our understanding of streaming platforms and obscuring their true disruptive impact (van Es 2023).

- **Summary:** Smart speakers, such as Google Home or Alexa Echo, have become increasingly popular in family houesholds over the past years – also in the Netherlands (Wald, Piotrowski, van Oosten, et al., 2024). Given that media use in families is known to impact children’s further upbringing and development (Arora & Arora, 2022; Valkenburg & Piotrowski, 2017) and that the integration of such smart devices in intimate spaces like families has broader implications for the design and regulation of the technology (Wald et al., 2023), it is crucial to learn more about how families concretely use these devices at home. Thus far, two main types of measurements have most often been used to assess smart speaker use: self-reports of users and actual registered interactions with the smart speaker. Yet, both measurements of smart speaker use have not yet been compared in research, leaving open to what extent they align, are feasible to obtain, and based on that are best suitable in what research scenario. The overarching aim of 'The Google Family Home' study is therefore to understand to what extent there is a systematic difference between self-reported (via survey) and observed smart speaker use (via data donations), and how Dutch families with young children actually use smart speakers at home, that is how frequently the device is used (use-frequency), for what activity (use-purpose), and by whom in the family (use-form) (Wald, van Oosten, Piotrowski, et al., 2024).
