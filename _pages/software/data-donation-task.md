## The Data Donation Task

The most important part of a study that follows the data donation workflow is the "data donation task". This is the step that facilitates that participants  can actually donate their data.

Since every study is interested in different platforms to collect data from, or in different parts of the data of a platform, the "data donation task" is an 
application that you can create yourself using a Python script. [Here](https://github.com/d3i-infra/data-donation-task) you can find the Github repository of the Data Donation Task. Read [this](https://d3i-infra.github.io/data-donation-task/) documentation to get started with the Data Donation Task.

There are many cools things you can do in a Data Donation Task. For example, you can make [visualizations](/software/visualizations/) for your participants. In addition, you can create all sorts of interactions between the participant and their data, see our [plugins](/software/plugins/) for ideas. 

If you don't feel like creating your own Data Donation Task, we have a set of ready-made scripts available for you to use directly. See [this](/software/ready-made-scripts/) page for more information about these scripts and how to use them.
