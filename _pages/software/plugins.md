The data donation task contains several features (or plugins) that allow the researcher to enhance their data donation study. 

Currently we have the following additions:

## Add a questionnaire

This section is for adding a few questions that don't require a full Qualtrics questionnaire. You can use donated data as input to this questionnaire. This allows researchers to do build interactive experiences for the participant. For example, in the case of a Facebook data donation study you can ask why they are a member of certain groups.

## Working with multiple files

Sometimes you'll want to ask for more than one file from the participant. That's why we have the multiple file input screen. Now you can ask more than 1 file from the participant: this could be useful in for example a WhatsApp data donation study, where the participant needs to donate more than 1 group chat.
