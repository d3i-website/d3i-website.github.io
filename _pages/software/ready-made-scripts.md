## Ready-made scripts

For some platforms, we provide and maintain default extraction scripts for the data donation task. You can use these in 
your data donation study using Port directly, or you can use them as a starting point to make your personalized script. 
More information and .zip files of the scripts will be added soon. For now, you can find this information [here](https://d3i-infra.github.io/data-donation-task/standard_scripts/index.html). 

| Platform| Date last update | Assumptions | Script |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Chat GPT    | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |
| Facebook    | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |
| Instagram   | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |
| LinkedIn    | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |
| Netflix     | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |
| TikTok      | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |
| WhatsApp    | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |
| X           | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |
| YouTube     | TBA   | TBA   |TBA   |

In addition, a list with links to scripts from previous studies available on GitHub. Note that these scripts can be outdated 
and not work properly anymore because either the platform changed its structure or it worked on an older version of Port.
