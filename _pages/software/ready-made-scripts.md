## Ready-made scripts

For some platforms, we provide and maintain default extraction scripts for the data donation task. You can use these in 
your data donation study using Port directly, or you can use them as a starting point to make your personalized script. 
More information and .zip files of the scripts will be added soon. For now, you can find this information [here](https://d3i-infra.github.io/data-donation-task/standard_scripts/index.html).
