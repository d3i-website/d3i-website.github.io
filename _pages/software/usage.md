Port can also be used in educational settings, for example in courses on digital literacy or courses that introduce novel methods of data collection. It can be used in three ways: exploring digital footprints, participating in a data donation study, and designing a study.


## Exploring digital trace data: digital footprint explorer


Using the Port software we have developed the [Digital Footprint Explorer](https://d3i-infra.github.io/dd-education/). Students can use the explorer to load and view their own platform data exports. Processing happens in the browser. It shows what data platforms provide and can be used in digital literacy courses as part of exercises on digital traces. If a platform is missing or out of date, feel free to contact us to request an update. Teachers with specific wishes for classroom use can also reach out to discuss possible adjustments.

## Participating in a data donation study

Students can contribute data to a study using Port. A study can be part of a course that introduces new forms of data collection and research participation. After donating, students can work with the data they have shared to answer a research question during the course. Studies can be run on Next in the Surf Research Cloud. Contact us if support is needed for setting up Next on Surf Research Cloud.


## Designing and participating in a data donation study

Students and teachers can also design their own studies using Port. A study can be part of a course where students learn to set up data collection and analysis. By modifying the Port software and writing their own extraction scripts, students can define what data is collected and how it is processed. These studies can also be run on Next in the Surf Research Cloud. Contact us if support is needed for setting up Next on Surf Research Cloud.
