## Visualizations

You can add visualizations of the data participants will be donating. This is a fun experience for the participants, and it gives the participants greater understanding of the data they are about to donate, thus making their decision to donate more informed.

Below you can find some examples:

### Wordcloud

## Add your own visualizations

Want to add your own visualizations?!

Please look at the [documentation page](https://d3i-infra.github.io/data-donation-task/getting_started/visualizations.html) on how to present data in visualizations to participants (in addition to tables).
