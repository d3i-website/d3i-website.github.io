Welcome at datadonation.eu, the website of [D3I](/d3i/), a project funded by [PDI-SSH](https://pdi-ssh.nl/en/). This website aims to bring together an international community of researchers interested in using data donation for research. 

You can find out more about [data donation](/data-donation/), how to [prepare a data donation study](/prepare-a-study/workflow), our data donation software, [`Port`](/software/), and an archive of past studies.
