Welcome at datadonation.eu, the website of [D3I](/d3i/project-d3i). This website 
aims to bring together an international community of researchers interested in 
using data donation for research. 

You can find out more about [data donation](/data-donation/), how to 
[prepare a data donation study](/prepare-a-study/study-design), our data donation 
software, [`Port`](/prepare-a-study/software), and an archive of past studies.

You can also subscribe to our [newsletter](/community/newsletter)! 

Enjoy and please reach out to one of our [team](/About-the-project/team) members in case you 
have any questions or comments!
